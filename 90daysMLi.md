## 🚀 The Mission
I am an 18-year-old CSE (AIML) Student documenting my journey from **Zero to Machine Learning Engineer** in exactly 90 days.

This repository contains every line of code, every project, and every error I encounter along the way. My philosophy is simple: **Code First, Theory Second.**

**Current Status:** `Day 1 / 90` 🔴
